# Flower Drawing with Turtle Graphics

This is a Python program that uses the Turtle graphics module to draw various types of flowers. The user inputs the name and quantity of flowers they'd like to see, and the program draws them at random positions on the canvas. 

## Flowers Available

- Rose

## How It Works

1. **Input:** The program accepts input from the user in the form of flower names and optional quantities (e.g., `3 roses`, `sunflower`, `2 orchids`).
2. **Drawing:** Based on the input, the program will draw the specified flowers in random positions.
3. **Unrecognized Flowers:** If the input includes unrecognized items, the program will notify the user and display the list of supported flowers.

## Issues

If the program doesn't recognize a flower you type, it'll give you suggestions based on the available options.
